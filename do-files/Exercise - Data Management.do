	//Reading Dates into STATA
	**Begin by importing/opening a STATA data file
	//Remember that import is different from open
	*HINT: Open - a STATA data. *Import - a data from another source e.g excel spreadsheet
	import delimited "PMTCT_CMIS.csv", varnames(1) clear
	browse //Browse the dataset to note data structure
	*All date related variables including Date of birth, dateofvist, ancstartdate and hivdiagnosed date are string
	***Remember variable types? 
	
	//Generate a new dateofbirth, note that the existing is structured as MDY
	generate dob_pmtct= date(dateofbirth_pmtct, "MDY") //genereate a new date of birth
	format dob_pmtct %td //format as a date.
	****************************
	//Repeat this process for others.
	generate ancstartdate_pmtct= date(ancstart_pmtct, "MDY") //genereate a new date of ANC Start
	format ancstartdate_pmtct %td //format as a date. ***ancstrt_pmtct

	generate hivdiagn_pmtct= date(hivdiagnosisdate_pmtct, "MDY") //genereate a new date of HIV diagnosis
	format hivdiagn_pmtct %td //format as a date.

	generate dov_pmtct= date(dateofvisit_pmtct, "MDY") //genereate a new date of visit
	format dov_pmtct %td //format as a date.
	drop dateofbirth_pmtct dateofvisit_pmtct hivdiagnosisdate_pmtct ancstart_pmtct //drop the previous date of birth variable
